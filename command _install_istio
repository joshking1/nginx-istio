# You can download it directly using the command

curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.19.0 sh -

# Add istioctl to Your PATH: After downloading, you will get an Istio directory (e.g., istio-1.19.0). 
# Change to that directory and add the istioctl tool to your system's PATH:

cd istio-1.19.0
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

# Verify Installation: You can verify that istioctl is installed and accessible by checking the version:

istioctl version

Run the Istio Installation Command - Once istioctl is installed, you can proceed with installing Istio using the demo profile by running:

istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
istioctl install --set profile=default -y

Key Differences:
Feature	Demo Profile (profile=demo)	                             Default Profile (profile=default)
Prometheus	Included	                                           Not included
Grafana	Included                          	                     Not included
Jaeger (Tracing)	Included	                                     Not included
Kiali (Service Mesh GUI)	Included	                             Not included
Egress Gateway	Included	                                       Not included
Sidecar Injection	Enabled	                                       Enabled
Resource Consumption	Higher (due to extra components)	         Lower (more lightweight)

# Label your namespace monitoring to enable automatic sidecar injection:
# The command kubectl label namespace ingress-nginx istio-injection=enabled is important because it enables automatic sidecar injection of the Istio Envoy proxy into all pods within the ingress-nginx namespace. 
# This is crucial for integrating services in that namespace into the Istio service mesh.

kubectl label namespace ingress-nginx istio-injection=enabled

# Configure Istio Gateway and VirtualService
# Now that Istio is installed and enabled for the monitoring namespace, letâ€™s set up the Istio ingress gateway and virtual service to route traffic to the NGINX service.
