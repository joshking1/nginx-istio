This diagram illustrates the architecture of an NGINX Ingress Controller in a Kubernetes cluster. Here's what it represents and how to interpret the different components:

Key Components in the Diagram:
Clients A and B:

These represent external users or clients trying to access services inside the Kubernetes cluster via URLs:
Clients A access http://a.example.com.
Clients B access http://b.example.com.
Public Endpoint:

This is the external entry point into your Kubernetes cluster, such as a load balancer or public IP address. It's where the traffic from Clients A and B hits first before being forwarded to the NGINX Ingress Controller.
NGINX Ingress Controller (IC):

IC Pod: The NGINX Ingress Controller is deployed as a pod inside the Kubernetes cluster, typically in the namespace nginx-ingress.
NGINX: Inside the IC pod, NGINX is used to manage the ingress traffic by routing it to the appropriate backend service based on the rules defined in the Ingress resources.
ConfigMap: This is the configuration used by the NGINX Ingress Controller to manage traffic routing and load balancing behavior.
Ingress A and VirtualServer B:

These are the Ingress resources or configurations that define how external traffic should be routed to different services inside the Kubernetes cluster.
Ingress A (for a.example.com): Routes traffic to Pod A in namespace A.
VirtualServer B (for b.example.com): Routes traffic to Pod B in namespace B.
Pods A and B:

Pod A: Represents the application or service associated with a.example.com in namespace A. Multiple replicas of Pod A are running.
Pod B: Represents the application or service associated with b.example.com in namespace B.
Kubernetes API:

The Kubernetes API is responsible for managing and interacting with resources in the Kubernetes cluster. The NGINX Ingress Controller communicates with the Kubernetes API to discover the ingress rules (like Ingress A and VirtualServer B) and route the incoming traffic accordingly.
Flow of Traffic:
Clients A (http://a.example.com):

Clients A send requests to the Public Endpoint.
The NGINX Ingress Controller inspects the Ingress resource (Ingress A), and based on the path or host rule, routes traffic to Pod A in namespace A.
Clients B (http://b.example.com):

Clients B send requests to the Public Endpoint.
The NGINX Ingress Controller inspects the Ingress resource (likely a custom resource like VirtualServer B) and routes traffic to Pod B in namespace B.
What It Means:
The diagram shows how the NGINX Ingress Controller acts as a middleman between external traffic (Clients A and B) and internal services (Pod A and Pod B).
Ingress Resources (like Ingress A and VirtualServer B) are used to define how traffic is routed based on hostnames or paths (e.g., /cart or /checkout in an eCommerce scenario).
The Public Endpoint is the entry point for all external requests, while the NGINX Ingress Controller handles the task of routing this traffic to the correct service pods inside the cluster.
